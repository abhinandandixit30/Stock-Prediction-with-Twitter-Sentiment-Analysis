# Stock-Prediction-with-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
In this I have made 2 different programs. One is using to extract Tweets and other is doing stock prediction by using a dataset of tweets.
I have used Tweepy to fetch the data from Twitter API and TextBlob To check the sentiments of the values. And for Stock Prediction I used a dataset. I have used Random Forest in that.
